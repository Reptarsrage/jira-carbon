## How to Report Style issues

### I don't know CSS

If you don't know CSS very well and have found a missing style, please include as much as possible of the following information when opening an issue:

* Screenshot of the problem; include the element(s) in the console if at all possible
  * To select an element, target it with your mouse then right-click and choose "Inspect Element"
  * Please include both the HTML view and the element with the problem in the screenshot (see [issue #119](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark/issues/119) for an example)
* A URL to the page (if public).

### I rock at CSS & GitHub!
